# ledger2beancount started as an ad hoc personal script. As such it was
# maintained in zack's private Ledger Git repository. It was later spun off
# as an independent project, when tbm started to heavily contribute to it. The
# script below was used to migrate the git history of ledger2beancount from
# zack's private repo to a new, independent one. It is ad hoc, uninteresting,
# and archived here just for historical reasons.
