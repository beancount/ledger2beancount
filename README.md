ledger2beancount
================

A script to automatically convert [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/)-based
textual ledgers to [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/) ones.

Conversion is based on (concrete) syntax, so that information that is not
meaningful for accounting reasons but still valuable (e.g., comments,
formatting, etc.) can be preserved.

Please [read the manual](docs/manual.md) on how to install, configure and
use ledger2beancount.  The [supported features](docs/manual.md#features)
are documented in the manual, too.


Usage
-----

ledger2beancount accepts input from `stdin` or from a file and will write
the converted data to `stdout`.  You can run ledger2beancount like this:

    ledger2beancount test.ledger > test.beancount


Installation
------------

Please see [the manual](docs/manual.md#installation) for dependencies and
installation instructions.
